9 Programming assignments
    General format is (bytes)->[Program]->(bytes)
      Grading program looks for correct (bytes)->(bytes)
      Should test code on Zoo so that it compiles & runs (correctly)
The <assert.h> library includes a function assert(expression) that will halt
  the program if expression is false
Useful standard libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.c, ctype.h, boolean.h?, assert.h

The function puts() is an easier way to output strings (don't have to do printf("\n");
